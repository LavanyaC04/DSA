# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my DSA repository! 🚀  
This repo contains all the Data Structures and Algorithms problems I'm solving as part of my 100 Days of Code challenge. I'm currently learning Java and DSA under the guidance of **Shradha Khapra** through **Apna College's Sigma 6.0** course.


## 🚀 Why This Repository?

This repo serves as my personal DSA journal. It includes solutions to problems I’ve solved, along with clear code, comments, and learnings. The goal isn’t just to solve problems — it's to understand the “why” behind each approach and improve logical thinking and coding speed.
