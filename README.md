# 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my DSA repository! 🚀  
This repository documents my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** as part of the **#100DaysOfCode** challenge. I’m currently learning Java and DSA under the mentorship of **Shradha Khapra** through the **Sigma 6.0 course by Apna College**.

## 🌟 Why This Repository?

This repo is more than just a code dump — it’s my digital learning journal. Every problem I solve is added with:

- ✅ Clear Java implementations  
- 💡 Intuition and multiple approaches (when applicable)  
- 🧠 Learnings and patterns recognized  
- 📚 Proper documentation and comments  

The mission is not just to solve problems — but to **think deeply**, **learn effectively**, and **code efficiently**.
